## Description

Debugging or troubleshooting a problem is a core skill for all developers. Debugging allows us to find and resolve errors, bugs, or other unexpected behavior. It helps maintain high-quality code by catching issues early in the development process and reduces the need for frequent maintenance and updates.

While revisiting proven solutions is valid, letâ€™s learn to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot for debugging.
